### 👋 Hi, I'm Tahreem Razzaq

🔬 M.Phil Molecular Biologist Student | Python Practitioner | Data Science Enthusiast

I’m currently diving deep into **Molecular biology, while expanding my skills in **Python, **Data Science, and **Bioinformatics to support research that matters.

💻 I enjoy simplifying complex biological data using Python and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
I’ve also been applying object-oriented programming and building clean, beginner-friendly data science projects.

📚 Recent work includes:
- Exploratory data analysis using Jupyter/Colab notebooks
- Class based code using OOP concepts
- Python mini-apps built from scratch
- Strong focus on clean code, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.

🧠 I value thoughtful learning, clean code, and connecting science with clarity.

Learning step by step and documenting the journey as I go.
